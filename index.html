		<p> <strong>My name is Meitar Ohayon. </strong> </br>
		I am a pastry chef, chocolatier, and instructor of baking workshops. </br>
		Over the years I have gained a lot of knowledge in a variety of fields:  </br> 
		showcase desserts, restaurant desserts, baking bread, working with Tabon, </br>
		ice cream production, service management, recruiting.	</br>
		In addition, I own an independent business of designed birthday cakes.</p>
		
		<p> In the last seven years, I have been involved in the patisserie business. </br>
			I wanted to learn another field in order to reach a place where I have options for advancement and growth, </br>
			to enter a new field, and expand my responsibilities. </br>
			I found a great interest in the QA (Quality Assurance) world and points of interface between the two fields. </br>
			In patisserie, attention to detail and perfectionism are required to succeed, </br>
			focusing on the small "bugs" in a cake or dessert until the product is perfect before it goes to the customer. </br>
			The same goes for QA, the requirement is quite similar, so I became curious and drawn into this world. </br> </p>
		
		<p> Four years ago I took a pastry course at "Estella" School </p>
		
		<a target="_blank" href="https://www.estella.co.il/"> click here for more information about "Estella" school </a> 
		
		<p> In the pastry studies at "Estella", I acquired knowledge of all pastry theory: crispy dough, cakes, creams, tarts, chocolate, </br>
			restaurant dessert, dough and breads, croissants, savory pastries, mousses...</p>

	<p> To expand my knowledge in the field, I participated in a training course of a pastry chef  - Johan Martin from France.</br>
		The content of the training was complex pastries that meet the definitions of innovation, beauty, and style.	</br>
		A fascinating training course.
